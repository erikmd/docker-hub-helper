## Example

* To update the local clone:

```bash
dhh branches
dhh reset --all  # if need be
```

* To add a commit in `master` and rebase stable branches:

```bash
cd $repo
git checkout master
git commit -a -m "Do something"
dhh rebase --all
```

* To dockerize a new stable branch of Coq, e.g. the patchlevel `8.8.2`:

```bash
dhh branches
dhh create --sed COQ_VERSION --from=8.8.1 8.8.2
  # open Docker Hub's build settings
  # and replace "8.8.1" with "8.8.2"; then
dhh delete 8.8.1
dhh push -n
dhh push
```

* To trigger the rebuild of `dev`:

```bash
dhh trigger -b dev coqorg/coq $token
```
